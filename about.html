          Suited for Change empowers women in need by providing free professional attire, 
          coaching, and skills training to help them secure employment and build lasting careers. 
          Each client begins with a personalized styling session, receiving two full outfits 
          and accessories to boost their confidence. This is followed by a virtual or in-person 
          coaching session to reinforce their qualifications and prepare them for interviews. 
          Once employed, clients return for three more outfits to expand their professional wardrobe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our virtual suiting experience, introduced during social distancing, offers additional 
          clothing and personal touches to lift spirits. Clients can further enhance their job 
          readiness through online workshops on various professional skills, provided by our partners at Edge. 
          All services are available at no cost through referrals from partner agencies, 
          ensuring comprehensive support and empowerment for our clients.
